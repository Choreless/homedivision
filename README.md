## Problem Statement
Chores are a never ending task in home life and are often overlooked when living with others. This can lead to frustration between housemates due to an untidy living space. Coordinating with housemates about who is responsible for which chore can be difficult, and may result in uncompleted chores. Our goal is to develop a platform that will support cooperation between housemates to make completing chores easier.

# Choreless by HomeDivision
## Problem Statement
Chores are a never ending task in home life and are often overlooked when living with others. This can lead to frustration between housemates due to an untidy living space. Working with housemates about who is responsible for each chore can be difficult, and may result in uncompleted chores. Some of such difficulties include: coordinating and distributing chores between housemates, recalling which chores each housemate must complete everyday, and incentivizing housemates to complete undesirable or tedious chores. Our goal is to develop a platform that will support cooperation between housemates to make completing chores easier.
